This slider is designed to display three elements as a mini-catalog or 
mode/game selector/...

It also works with mobile events. To operate just click on the white icon 
or in mobile version scroll your finger from the center to the right
to activate the scrolling.

Setup proyect and repository

## Getting Started

To use this plugin it is necessary to include the latest version of jQuery 
currently available in [3.x](https://releases.jquery.com/)

You must include/copy the plugin, which is currently located in the directory

    foil-slider/foil-slider.js
  
Finally, the css file must be linked/copy:

    style.css

This is generated from a Sass compiler from the source file style.scss. 
Currently the styles applied are example styles and we try to keep the responsibility for
the size to the developer to apply their own customization styles. 

## Running 

To create a new instance it is necessary to create a div with the data-attribute
of [foil-slider] and inside it must contain the images that we want to show in the 
show in the slider:

```html 
<div class="my-slider" foil-slider>
    <img src="cyberpunk.png" alt=""/>
    <img src="mediaval.png" alt=""/>
    <img src="zombies.png" alt=""/> 
</div> 
```

It is important to note that currently it only works with img elements only. 
The slider transforms into divs with a series of options and settings.

Then in our javascript we will create the instance:

 ```javascript
 $(function($){
    "use strict";

    // foillider instance
    $('.my-slider').foilSlider({});
});
```
